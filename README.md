# 2020 Ryerson University Python Camp Demo

## Task 1
Write a program which adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides two variables

## Task 2
Write a program which finds the Factorial of a number

## Task 3
Write a program which finds the largest and smallest number in an array

## Task 4
Write a program which sorts an array in ascending and descending order

## Task 5
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based on a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
* D 300
* D 300
* D 100
* W 200

## Task 6
Find all numbers between 2000 and 3200, which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5

## Task 7
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: **UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2**. The numbers after the direction are steps. Write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.

## Task 8
Files are backed up with the following name format every day: yearmonthday_backup_appname.xyz,
* e.g. 
* day1: 20190101_backup_prtg.zip
* day2: 20190102_backup_prtg.zip
write a program which creates a string with the filename for all the days in all the months in a year

## Task 9
You have two variable; a = 5 and b = 3, Swap the integers such that a = 3 and b = 5, without creating additional variables

## Task 10
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [$#@]
5. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
6. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
